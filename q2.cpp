/*What does the following mean? What would it be good for?
typedef int (&rifii) (int, int);*/

/*The statement typedef int (&rifii)(int, int); defines rifii as an alias for a reference
to a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int. 

This alias makes it easier to refer to functions of this type. Itâ€™s useful for simplifying 
code, especially when passing or storing function references, and improves readability by 
avoiding repetitive function signatures. For example, you can use rifii to create a reference
to a function and call it using a simpler name.*/
