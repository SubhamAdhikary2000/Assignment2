/*
The callCount variable is declared globally, meaning it can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.
This approach is straightforward and allows for easy tracking of calls.
Drawback: Using global variables can lead to issues with name collisions and make debugging more difficult.
It also introduces the risk of unintended modifications from other parts of the code.

/*
The callCount variable is declared as static, meaning it retains its value between
function calls, but it is only accessible within the function.
This encapsulates the counting logic, preventing external code from altering callCount.
Benefit: This method reduces the risk of name collisions and makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

A local variable would reset its value every time the function is called.
Therefore, it wouldnâ€™t be able to keep track of the number of calls accurately.
